MusixBox is a real world Chinese Music app company. 

The data used in this project is their user log files during 2017-03-01 to 2017-05-12. Total file size is around 15GB.

The data sits on AWS, accessible to the public.

There are 3 types of logs -  play, download , search. 

play log has details of users' play time, songid, song length. 
download and search log has only the footprint when and what user search and download.

Given the file size is too large for Pandas to handle. I used Pyspark to do all the data cleaning, feature tranformation and engineering.
Based on all these info I have, I created ~23 features based on users' fequency and recency of play/download/search behaviors within different time windows.
