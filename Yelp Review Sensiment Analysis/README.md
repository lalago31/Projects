# Sentiment Analysis and Recommender System - Yelp

## Project Overview
The data source for this project is from Kaggle [Yelp dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset). I used the Yelp business and review datasets.

The analysis consists 3 parts:
1. Exploratory analysis of the Yelp business and review datasets, explore the most common words in the positive and negative reviews.
2. Transformed the text reviews into feature vectors with NLP techniques and built classification models to pred. ict the review sentiments.
3. Built 3 types of recommender systems to recommend new restaurants to users they might like using item-item collaborative filtering, NMF and UVD matrix factorization.
